# Software entreprise Project 2024: GatherSpot
Have you ever wanted to meet people in real life who share your intersts and hobbies? Look no further than the GatherSpot App.

GatherSpot is an android application where we want to make it easy for people to gather and organize events. 

You can for example create your own event and make it possible for people nearby to join it and take part into it. 

Users will be able to locate nearby events on a map and filter them out based on their taste and availability. 

Users can respond to event organizers through a messaging feature. 

After attending an event, users can rate it and give feedback for potential future participants.

On the other hand, event organizers will be able to report users who didn't attend their gathering.
